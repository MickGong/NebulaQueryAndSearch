## Issue
--Coming soon--

## Goals
The overall goal of the project is to help auto-generate dynamic SOQL for commonly used queries
* Provide a structure to centralise frequently used queries for each SObject
* Provide a configurable way to change the query fields, while still preventing accidental deletion of fields being used
* Provide a way to create a WHERE statement as a string in Apex, while still preventing accidental deletion of fields being used

## Implementation
--Coming soon--

### Example Implementation: LeadQueryRepository.cls
